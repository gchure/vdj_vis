- section: Comparing contributions of individual changes to their com- bined effects in DNA sequence

    One of the most fascinating features of the immune system in humans is
    not only its ability to produce a vast array of antibody types to
    identify any invasive bacterium or virus-infected cell, but also the
    elegance of making antibody assembly by cutting and joining different
    regions of DNA. The initial cutting part of this process involves a
    protein called RAG, as anthropomorphized into hands in the figure,
    grabbing onto two regions of the DNA to form a DNA loop, shown with
    purple and blue backbones, each adjacent to antibody-encoding sequences
    selected for joining. RAG attaches to these two regions because they
    exhibit certain sequence patterns that are amenable for binding. RAG cuts
    the DNA between these sites and the antibody-encoding portions before
    other proteins complete the DNA joining phase for cells to make
    antibodies.

    While RAG binds and cuts specific regions of the DNA because of the
    recognizable sequence patterns, these sites can still vary in sequence
    within the genome. In a study that we recently published in Nucleic Acids
    Research, we examined the extent to which RAG will bind and cut the DNA
    if we modify a binding site sequence at multiple positions and compared
    the contributions of each nucleotide modification to the collective
    effect. We illustrate some of our findings in this visual, which is
    modified from a page in the Supplementary website that accompanies our
    publication. In this interactive visual, we show three example
    comparisons between effects of several single nucleotide changes from
    some starting sequence and that of combining these replacements into a
    single sequence. Through the dropdown menu, one can select any of these
    three binding site sequences to reveal the effects of the sequence and
    the individual effects of its constitutive changes. The upper left plot
    shows the frequency that RAG creates a DNA loop for the combination of
    changes to the far right and the individual changes to the left, with
    position along the sequence where the change was made as the x-axis. The
    plot on the upper right shows full posterior distributions of the
    probability that RAG cuts the DNA with the altered sequence. In the
    bottom row, we present three cumulative distribution functions to show
    (from left to right) how much time it takes before DNA unloops without
    cutting, is cut, or a compilation of the two possible fates. To more
    easily compare one particular single nucleotide change against the
    combined changes, hovering the mouse over a colored nucleotide in the
    sequence below the dropdown menu will send the rest of the data into the
    background and present only the individual change with the superposition
    of changes.

    Some nucleotides can have a dominating influence on how well RAG binds or
    cuts the DNA. For the sequence called V8-18, the change from T to A at
    position six prevents RAG from binding these sites. Antibody-encoding DNA
    segments neighboring binding sites with this T-to-A change are rarely
    selected, which presents significant obstacles to making the antibody
    necessary for fighting off some infections.
