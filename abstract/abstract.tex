\section*{Comparing contributions of individual changes to their combined effects in DNA sequence}
\author{Griffin Chure, Soichi Hirokawa}

One of the most fascinating features of the immune system in humans is not only
its ability to produce a vast array of antibody types to identify any invasive bacterium or virus-infected cell,
but also the elegance of making antibody assembly by cutting and joining different regions of DNA. 
The initial cutting part of this process involves a protein called RAG, as anthropomorphized into hands in the figure, 
grabbing onto two regions of the DNA to form a DNA loop, shown with purple and blue backbones, each adjacent to 
antibody-encoding sequences selected for joining. RAG attaches to these two regions because they exhibit certain
sequence patterns that are amenable for binding. RAG cuts the DNA between these sites and the 
antibody-encoding portions before other proteins complete the DNA joining phase for cells to make antibodies.

While RAG binds and cuts specific regions of the DNA because of the recognizable sequence patterns, 
these sites can still vary in sequence within the genome. In a study that we 
recently published in \emph{Nucleic Acids Research}, we wanted to understand how replacing nucleotides at one or
multiple positions of some binding site sequence alters the extent to which RAG will bind
and cut the DNA. We illustrate some of our findings in this visual, which is modified from a page in 
\href{https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/vdj_recombination}{the Supplementary website that accompanies our publication}. 
In this interactive visual, we show three example comparisons between effects of several single nucleotide changes 
and that of combining these replacements in a single sequence. Through the dropdown menu, one can select
any of these three binding site sequences to reveal the effects of the sequence and the individual effects of its constitutive
changes. The plot to the upper left shows the frequency that RAG creates
a DNA loop for the combination of changes to the far right and the individual changes to the left, 
with position along the sequence where the change was made as the x-axis. The plot on the upper right shows full posterior
distributions of the probability that RAG cuts the DNA with the altered sequence. In the bottom row, we present three cumulative
distribution functions to show (from left to right) how much time it takes before DNA unloops without cutting, 
is cut, or a compilation of the two possible fates. If one wants to more easily compare one particular
single nucleotide change against the combined changes, hovering the mouse over a colored 
nucleotide in the sequence below the dropdown menu will send the rest of the data into the background
and present only the individual change and the combination of changes. 

Some nucleotides can have a dominating influence on how well RAG binds or cuts
the DNA. For the sequence called V8-18, the change from T to A at position six prevents
RAG from binding these sites. Antibody-encoding DNA segments neighboring binding sites with this T-to-A change
are rarely selected, which presents significant obstacles to making the antibody necessary for fighting off some infections.
